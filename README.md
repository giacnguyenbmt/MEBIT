# MEBIT

Model evaluation by image transformations

## Description

A Python class evaluates the robustness of Computer vision models (classification, object detection, text detection and text recognition) when input data is changed by image transformations.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone MEBIT repository
git clone https://github.com/giacnguyenbmt/MEBIT.git

# Install other dependencies
pip install -r MEBIT/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- For classification evaluation, please refer to the  [document](https://github.com/giacnguyenbmt/MEBIT/tree/main/mebit/demo/trafficlight_classification).
- For object detection evaluation, please refer to the  [document](https://github.com/giacnguyenbmt/MEBIT/tree/main/mebit/demo/object_detection).
- For text detection evaluation, please refer to the  [document](https://github.com/giacnguyenbmt/MEBIT/tree/main/mebit/demo/text_detection).
